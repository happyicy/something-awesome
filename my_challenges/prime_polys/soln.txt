Looking at the polynomial for q, we note that p**4 < q < (p+1)**4.
This means that our n = pq is bounded by p**5 < n < (p+1)**5.
Taking the floor of the 5th root of n gives us p, and from there decrypting is easy.

The purpose of this challenge was to demonstrate the dangers of picking two primes
that are related, inspired by Square Eyes.
