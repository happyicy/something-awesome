Inferius Prime
When primes are small, it is easy to find p and q, so we lose
Factordb is amazing

Monoprime
When n is prime, phi = n-1, finding the decryption key is easy

Square eyes
If n = p^2, finding the square root is very easy
    - Idea: do a ctf problem using twin primes -> find sqrt of n, then the numbers beside it must be the primes we want

Manyprime
Factorise using alpertron
